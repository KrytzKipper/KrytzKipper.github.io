                            <h3>My Journey</h3>
                            <p>Ever since I was a child I have loved the thoughts of building my own ideas. It started off with lego bricks and airfix aircraft. As soon as I finished school and got my first job, I built my first PC. A Intel Core i5 2600 paired with a GTX 1060 and 16 gb or ram. A build I will never forget, mainly for the reason that I spend most of the beginning on an old 720p TV. Growing up playing video games had a huge impact on my life and still does to this day, so it goes that a few years back I decided to pursue video game design. I started with a level 5 PLC in Ballyfermot College and enjoyed every moment of it. The next year I was in the first year of the level 6 course and due to running into some bad health problems I had to give the course up halfway through. That illness has had me out of action for a number of years, but although I was not in a position to develop, ideas constantly flew through my head. </p>
                            
                            <p>Being back on my feet now has given me the fuel to get back into what I love. I have build this website to house the contents or my learning and also the projects I make along the way. I have aspirations to make it into software development and this website it going to hopefully get things running. Whether I am making video game, mobile phone apps, windows programs, working front and or back end. I know that I just enjoy creating. But come on, who would say no to Full stack developing? you get to build behind the scenes and get the reward of making a good services for a customer. Onwards and upwards!</p>
                            
                            <h3>Philosophy & Approach</h3>
                            <p>I have come to learn two very important things in life. First is that hard work does pay off once it is honest hard work, even if you do not reach your ultimate goal, the satisfaction of being able to say you really tried helps a long way. Second is that if you put your mind to it, you can truly achieve anything. There is certain things that an individual can never achieve due to circumstances out of their control, but if it is in your contol, it can be achieved. This is the way I look forward to bring the best of me out.
