								<h3>A new beginning</h3>

								<p>Sniper Elite 5 is an ambitious attempt at sandbox level design, and in many ways it pays off. The introduction of Axis Invasion mode made the level design feel more purposeful, while also adding massive replayability to the game. Each map is unique and offers different play styles to the player. It is not just about sniping, stealth is a very big factor. While the story is basic on surface level and includes the player having to stop the production of an axis super weapon, like all of the Sniper Elite games so far, it is clear that the player is there for the gameplay first.</p>

								<h3>The Good and The Bad</h3>

								<p>Players of previous installments will notice some changes throughout their playthough. Rebellion, while introducing new mechanics, removed several features present in Sniper Elite 4, most notably the ability to crouch-run, the S-Mine and tripwire trap options. These are game mechanics that are widely missed by the Sniper Elite community and I have to say that I agree. Sniper Elite 4 is generally known as the best game and I think a mixture of mechanics and level design seem to be the reason why in the general consensus. While some features are missed, Sniper Elite 5 is massively applauded for what it does right. The introduction of Axis Invasion was a big win for the game. The invading player plays as a german sniper who is brought into the campaign of another player and tasked with taking them down. In my experience, map knowledge is the most crucial aspect in this game mode. Being able to predict where your enemy may move next before they even do could be the difference in victory or defeat. This gives the players effectively infinite replayability as long as there are people online, and in my experience is does not be too difficult to find a game. The game does a very good job at making each mission feel diverse. From rain soaked Guernsey to the inferno of the war factory, the massive tower which is the axis spy academy to the falling war torn city of rubble and ruin, every mission has a design which is unique and is easy to be remember. The survival and multiplayer modes are pretty much a copy and paste from the previous entry, which is not a bad thing. Better not to try and fix something that is not broken. </p>

								<h3>Technical Analysis</h3>

								<p>Looking at the game from a technical perspective, I am extremely impressed. I really enjoy physics simulation in video games and Rebellion have always hit the nail on the head with the bullet mechanics. If it was just good bullet physics it would be one thing, but the trademark slow motion x-ray killcam makes for a unique shots to be made by the player. The Asura game engine is Rebellions in house engine which they have build from the ground up. Due to this, the game is extremely well optimized and players can expect to get really good performance even on hardware they would not expect. It utilizes advancements in photogrammetry, enhanced water rendering with tessellation, and improved texture filtering and it also supports features like parallax occlusion maps, advanced AI, and large-scale, detailed environments. I would personally really enjoy working on a game like this in the future.</p>
								
								<h3>Conclusion</h3>

								<p>I think the game is fantastic at what it does. The only negative I really have about the game is that the developers felt the needed to remove mechanics that were enjoyed by the player. Perhaps this was purposely done due to level design. For solo players, the diverse maps offer great replayability and that that is enhanced even more with the new axis invasion. The game physics are the same as previous entries but improved upon. The formula works well for rebellion and their player base seems to grow with each new entry. Next on my list is Sniper Elite: Resistance, so we will see how that compares!</p>
							
							    <p><strong>Final Score: 9/10 - A must play for fans of tactical stealth and fun physics.</strong></p>
