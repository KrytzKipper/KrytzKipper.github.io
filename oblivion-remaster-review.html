                        <p><strong>The Introduction:</strong> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is a fantasy role playing game that is set in the province of Tamriel. The original game released in 2006 and is known as one of the best game if its time. I jump into the remaster of this special game to see if the game has been love it deserves</p>
                        
                        <h3>Did it receive the deserved care?</h3>
                        <p>At a first glance, Oblivion Remastered looks fantastic. The visual boost it was given all round was nothing but fantastic, unfortunately it seems to have come at a cost. The game was developed using Unreal Engine 5 as an overlay on top of Bethesda's creation engine. That is not inherently a bad thing, but the way it was executed was not done with great respect. Everything looks visually stunning because every new texture is 4k or 8k, and this is a problem because there was no compression attempted. This results in the remaster clocking in at 120GB while the original is 26 times smaller at 4.6GB. With all that being said, this had lead to a lot of performace issues for players, and I am not just talking about the typical Bethesda bugs. I do think that using the creation engine underneath the hood was the correct move though. When a game like Oblivion is remastered, any returning players from the original game will want the exact same experience. Jumping up a mountain sideways by spamming the jump key or crouch running into a wall at a local tavern to level up your sneak. These are all things that if changed, would only be suited for the new player that never experienced the original release.</p>
                        
                        <blockquote>"Yes, oh great and mighty Grand Champion? Is there something you need? Can I carry your weapon? Shine your boots? Backrub, perhaps?"</blockquote>

                        <h3>Loading back into Cyrodil</h3>
                        <p>It was so good to be back. Oblivion was one of my most beloved games growing up and I cannot keep track of the amount of playthroughs I completed. The world just feels so alive. I have often spent many an evening just slowly making my way around the map and taking in the stunning scenery, just living in the moment and taking it slow. I believe Oblivion is a game that is meant to be enjoyed at a slow pace. One of the aspects of the game that sets it apart from the others in my opinion is the humour. I do not know whether it is intentional or not but the way the characters speak, the facial expressions, the dialogue that they have. I believe the whole game is voice acted by no more than 20 people. Possibly that is what added the unique character? Who can ever forget the adoring fan. He is the most annoying character to ever be in a video game, but he is also famous for that reason. If you have not played the game yet, make your way to the arena in your own time and you will see for yourself. Would I recommend this game? Without a shadow of a doubt I would, but choosing between the original and the remaster is a tougher question. To be honest, it all comes down to how much you want to spend versus how much you care about improved graphics, or how much of a connection you have the original game. For instance, is nostolgia a big factor. There is also the aspect of the new game being digital only, so if you are looking to pick up a physical copy, the original is the only way. If you can find it on a good sale, I will have to recommend the remaster, but my heart always lies back in 2006. </p>

                            <h3>The Verdict</h3>
                            <p><strong>Pros:</strong> A brilliant story retold in stunning visuals</p>
                            <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Those visual come at a cost, extraordinary install size and developers and very slow to patch the game</p>
                            <p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong> Definitely play the game, though the original game might be a better bet depending on your circumstance. my review score will be based on the remaster alone.</p>
